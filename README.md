# qdrant-demo

## Assignment
- **Infra part.**  
Set up a Qdrant Hybrid Cloud deployment with a Kubernetes environment running on your local machine. Then, create a Qdrant cluster in it with two nodes and configure an API key for authentication.

- **Search part.**  
Implement a working Hybrid Search (with Sparse and Dense vectors) example app with Qdrant using Python. You can use any dataset and any embedding models. No UI is needed, just the code. That's it.
Everything you need to complete the task you should be able to find in Qdrant documentation.
After you are done, push the source code to a public Git repository and send us a link for review.

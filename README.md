# qdrant-demo

## Assignment
- **Infra part.**  
Set up a Qdrant Hybrid Cloud deployment with a Kubernetes environment running on your local machine. Then, create a Qdrant cluster in it with two nodes and configure an API key for authentication.

- **Search part.**  
Implement a working Hybrid Search (with Sparse and Dense vectors) example app with Qdrant using Python. You can use any dataset and any embedding models. No UI is needed, just the code. That's it.
Everything you need to complete the task you should be able to find in Qdrant documentation.
After you are done, push the source code to a public Git repository and send us a link for review.


## Steps Used for this Demo
1. Create empty repo
2. Create go mod

11. Edit the qdrant pvc and modified the 'storageClassName' and 'volumeName' attributes
12. On 2 different nodes, I installed qdrant source and built code using cargo
13. Running 2 instance in debug mode and will modify the config file to ensure p2p communication, then replicate it on K8 instances
14. 2 nodes were configured with p2p functionality
15. Verified cluster were configured properly
16. Created a Private Cloud installation https://qdrant-demo.mavcode.io/dashboard using Helm on a local K8 and exposed it via Ingress with TLS enabled.

18. Used Python, Go, and Curl, to create collections and injest data to all three types of deployments
19. Reviewed the Hybrid Search online tutorials and studied the example codes
20. Wrote initial version of Go application to use for performant ingestions to qdrant db 
20. Wrote a simple python script to do hybrid search on the hybrid cloud cluster deployment using online example data

```
python scripts/hybrid-search.py -u <qdrant endpoint url> -k <api key> -m <dense model> <sparse model> -s <collection> <search text> <max number of return hits>

example:
python scripts/hybrid-search.py -u http://qdrant.mavcode.io:6333 -k <API KEY> -m sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1 -s startups "Two dogs in the snow" 10
